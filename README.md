17. *Socket* - A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to.A socket is identified by an IP address concatenated with port number.
18. *TCP* - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation by which applications can exchange data.
19. *MAC Address* - Media Access Control address is a unique identifier assigned for use as a network address in communications within a network segment.
20. *Protocol*- It is a standardized set of rules for formatting and processing data.
21. *Firmware* - It is a microcode or program that is embedded into the memory of hardware devices to help them operate.
22. *TLS* - Transport Layer Security encrypts data sent over the Internet.
23. *Cache* - A cache is a high-speed data storage layer which stores a subset of data (temporary mermory).
24. *STACK* - Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.
25. *LIFO* (Last In First Out)

26.Von Neuman Architecture *VS* Harvard Architecture   
The main difference between Von Neumann and Harvard architecture is that Von Neumann architecture uses a single memory for all program elements, while Harvard architecture uses two separate memories.

24. *Debian* - Debian is a free and open-source operating system (OS) for computers. It uses a Unix-like kernel, typically Linux, and other program components from the GNU Project.
25. *GNU*-GNU is a free and open-source operating system. 
 It's made up of 385 packages of free software. GNU can be used as an operating system or in parts with other operating systems. The use of GNU tools led to the family of operating systems known as Linux.
26. *VMware Workstation* - VMware Workstation is a line of products that allow users to run virtual machines, containers, and Kubernetes clusters.

28. *VPN*(Virtual private newtwork) - It establishes a digital connection between your computer and a remote server owned by a VPN provider, creating a point-to-point tunnel that encrypts your personal data, masks your IP address, and lets you sidestep website blocks and firewalls on the internet.
29. *Cryptography* - It is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. It is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages.
30. 30. *Hypervisor* - It is a type of computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines.

| Type I  | Type II |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Native (bare metal hypervisor)  | Hosted hypervisor  |
| Installed directly on hardware and runs guest OS  | Runs on previously installed OS/installed on top of a os |
| Acts as light weight as it runs directly  | Runs as software like other computer programs  |
